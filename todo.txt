done:


convoluted histograms do not need to be normalised by number of events
           are already divided by bin width

added in grid steering architecture, use 2 bins for Q2 around 174 176
(could be one, but there seems to be bug)


-------------------------------------------------

to be done:

test LO convolution with quarks

test NLO: 
 test convolute B,R and R+B
 first gluon only



automatic setup for factorisation scale boundaries
introduce fac_scale sets bounderies of q2Low q2Up 
(see code fragment in makegridfromsherpa

look at grid formation with one Q2 bins
need to fix this in appl_grid
 if ( m_Ntau>1 ) m_deltatau = (taumax-taumin)/(m_Ntau-1);
  else            m_deltatau = 0;

lowest_order = 2; to be steered from MyData or MyCrossSection steering
decide myorder on basis of lowest_order insteed of nproc


check Adding B and R for references and grids
use Marc applgrid-combine

Normlize functions, set number of entries to values before normalisation
not number of bins

Why is in src not appl_grid ?
src/appl_igrid.h:

put debug print-out on appl_igrid convolute 

Marc:
remove generic_pdf 
rename lumi_pdf to generic_pdf

compare to grid from mcfm
put publish Atlas data grids on svn
together with examples
